# Flask RC4 Encryption/Decryption Tool

This project is a simple web-based application that implements the RC4 encryption and decryption algorithm using Python's Flask framework. It allows users to encrypt or decrypt text using a specified key and choose the bit length of the key for enhanced security.

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt text using the RC4 algorithm.
- Adjust the key length based on selected bit options (64-bit, 128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit).
- Simple and interactive web interface.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python and Flask installed on your system. If you don't have Flask installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install flask
```

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-rc4-encryption.git
cd flask-rc4-encryption
```

### Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start a local server on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which you can visit using your web browser to start using the application.

## Usage

1. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.
2. Enter the text you wish to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Enter the key and select the desired key bit length.
4. Choose the operation (Encrypt or Decrypt).
5. Submit the form to see the result.
